# MetDataAug
Condensed version of the code related with the artificial augmentation of metabolomics data by generating artificial samples based on 'real' experimental samples

#### Note: Run Linear Augmentation of Data notebook first to generate the dataset store (processed_data_GD) used in other notebooks.

Code and notebooks related to the developed MDiN functions are also present here since they are not present in the paper_sMDiN repository (they were not addressed in the paper that led to that repository).

We acknowledge many different online platforms that provided code that was adapted to make different types of GAN. The specific links for each platform are described in the respective notebooks and before the functions in GAN_functions. 

In general, we thank the online platforms such as Tensorflow (as an example https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan), Keras (as an example https://keras.io/examples/generative/wgan_gp/#wasserstein-gan-wgan-with-gradient-penalty-gp) and machinelearningmastery among others for their tutorials on the architecture and training of different types of GANs.
